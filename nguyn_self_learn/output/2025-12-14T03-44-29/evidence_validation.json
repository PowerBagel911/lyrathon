  "match_score": 54.17,
  "summary": "The match score reflects the alignment between the listed code skills and the evidence found in the provided GitHub repositories.  Skills like Docker, AWS Cloud Service and Azure could not be verified through GitHub.  The score is based solely on 'code' category skills. Some skills are marked as 'indirectly_supported' when strong contextual clues exist, but direct evidence is absent. Note that the 'mention_count' on the CV increases the confidence of skills, but this has no impact on the score due to Github's limitations in verifying these skills.",
