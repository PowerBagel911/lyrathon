  "match_score": 54.17,
  "summary": "The match score reflects the alignment between the CV's listed coding skills and evidence found within the provided GitHub repositories. Several non-coding skills (Docker, AWS Cloud Service, Azure) could not be validated through GitHub evidence and are marked accordingly. The score prioritizes direct evidence such as language usage and dependencies. Indirect evidence, such as the presence of related libraries, contributed to a partial score. Note that GitHub evidence is limited and may not fully represent the candidate's skill set, particularly for tools and cloud services.",
