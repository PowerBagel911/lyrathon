  "summary": "The candidate is most suited for the AI/Machine Learning Engineer (Job 4) role due to their validated Python skills, which are critical for this role. The Data Analyst (Job 2) role is a secondary fit, primarily due to validated Python skills. The Full Stack Developer role (Job 1) is a weaker fit because key skills like JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js are not validated. The Cybersecurity Analyst role (Job 3) is the least suitable given the lack of directly supported skills in networking or security tools.",
