  "match_score": 62.5,
  "summary": "The match score reflects the alignment between claimed coding skills and evidence found in the provided GitHub repositories. Skills like Docker, AWS Cloud Service, and Azure are classified as 'not_verifiable_via_github' as GitHub evidence doesn't directly support these. The score calculation is based solely on 'code' skills. It's important to note that GitHub repositories might not fully represent an individual's complete skillset, especially regarding non-coding skills.",
