  "summary": "The candidate is best suited for the Data Analyst role (Job 2). Their Python and SQL skills (though SQL is only indirectly supported) align well with the requirements. HTML/CSS can be used for front end development for dashboards. The AI/ML role (Job 4) is a reasonable second option, given Python proficiency and potential for data preprocessing. The Full Stack Developer role (Job 1) has a lower score because while HTML/CSS skills are validated, Javascript, React, Node.js are not validated. The Cybersecurity Analyst role (Job 3) has no skill overlap. ",
