  "summary": "The match score is 62.5%, reflecting alignment between the CV's coding skills and evidence found in the provided GitHub repositories. Python and HTML/CSS are directly supported by the repositories' language statistics and dependencies. C#, C++, Ruby, SQL, R, and Java are not verifiable through GitHub evidence. Docker, AWS Cloud Service, and Azure are non-code skills, and therefore categorized as not verifiable via GitHub, but their mention counts indicate confidence in the claims.",
