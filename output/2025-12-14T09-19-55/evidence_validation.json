  "match_score": 62.5,
  "summary": "The match score reflects the alignment between the candidate's claimed code skills and the evidence found in their GitHub repositories. Skills like Docker, AWS Cloud Service, and Azure are categorized as tools and therefore 'not_verifiable_via_github', they do not contribute to the score. While mention_count might increase confidence in non-code skills, GitHub's visibility into these is limited.  The final score is 62.5%.",
