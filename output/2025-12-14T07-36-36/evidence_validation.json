  "match_score": 62.5,
  "summary": "The match score reflects the alignment between the CV's claimed code skills and the evidence found in the provided GitHub repositories. Skills in the 'tool', 'networking', and 'certification' categories are inherently difficult to verify through GitHub repositories and are classified as 'not_verifiable_via_github'. These skills do not contribute to the match score. The score is based on directly and indirectly supported code skills. Python and C# are directly supported, while HTML/CSS, PHP, and SQL are indirectly supported by associated web-related projects. Bash and Ruby were not verifiable. PowerShell was not found in the repositories.",
